TheWindyCityBreeze
An amazing website for and up and coming Youtube and Espn star named PatTheDesigner and his group! The website was made to help push they're content and for people to get to know them more!

We used Javascript, CSS, EJS, Express, and Mongodb for the database to create this site!

I wanted to create something for them that would be simple but look amazing! I feel like I accomplished that with the result I acchevied. Most of the time I spent building a back-end that would funtion well using CRUD and working with api's. Some ways I did this was by adding simple button functionality leading to different pages, creating a form for an email listing, and using event listeners for the drop down and carousel. Even though it's still in progress I've spent over 100 hours working on something I felt could truly help them get to the next level and I can't wait to see how it helps them grow!

Optimization
One thing we're looking to finish is adding in the shop feature using shopify. I probably will end up using the shopify api to add in the storefront section and for sales on the back-end.
